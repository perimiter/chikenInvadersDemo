Chicken Invaders is
a long running series of shoot-em-up games based on the old
arcade classic Space Invaders where you shoot chickens,
destroy their evil plans and save Earth (and humanity too).
The core mechanics of the games are very simple:
you clear waves of chickens and other enemies,
avoid eggs and other projectiles, collect power -
ups to make your weapon stronger
That's all you need to know!
